      <h2 class="is-size-1">The silent epidemic: a dive into domestic homicides in Spain</h2>

        Some days ago, news outlets from my home country screamed blue murder after a 17-year-old girl was killed by her ex-boyfriend in Murcia, Southeastern region.
        A total of three women have already been murdered this 2022. And it's only February 18th.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
      In 2003 the Spanish Government started to collect data related to what was nationaly coined as "gender violence" or "sexist violence";
      this is any kind of agression (physical, phycological, verbal, etc.) perpetrated against women mainly by an intimate partner, and anchored in an imbalanced system of male domination.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        We dediced to analyze the number of sexist murders per 100,000 female residents, what allowed us to see how small territories, 
	like La Rioja or Cantabria register the highest rate of murders. Since 2003, 6 women have been killed in La Rioja (with a female population of around 160,000),
	      14 in Navarra and 10 in Cantabria, with a female population of 330,000 and less than 300,000 women, respectively.

      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
      At the same time, we also explored the number of complaints per domestic murder. This is, how many complaints occur in a territory 
      per each woman that ended up killed, and the differences are enormous. For instance, in Ceuta and Melilla *there is* a gender murder every 300 police complaints, while on the opposite side of the spectrum,
      in Madrid that happens after more than 3,800 reports to police, followed by Murcia with more than 3,500.</p>
      
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
      In these two territories, we could say that there is a high level of behind-the-scenes domestic violence (according to the high number of police complaints) that fortunetly 
      don't end up in killings. Equally, more effort should be done by the local government and different strategies should be implemented in territories like Ceuta and Melilla, 
      as well as the autonomous community of La Rioja, to better understand the real scale of sexist violence, since the number of police complaints seems underreported in relation to the number of killings.

      <h3 class="has-text-left is-size-4">A long way to go in police complaints</h3>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        It is important to notice that most of those police complaints are made by the own police officers after they have responded to a domestic violence call. 
        Sadly, most women that suffer violence by an intimate partner do not report, which makes it harder to implement successful protection measures.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        Since 2006, when this data was first available, around 27% of all 927 women killed had reported their partners to police.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-left is-size-4">
        Asturias have the worst percentage, with only 12% of women who had made a complaint before being murdered. The highest percentage of complaints is hold by Extremadura
        where 4 out of 8 women killed had previously reported to police. These numbers show that a police complaint doesn't always prevent another gender homicide.
