    After 3+ years covering East Africa and Israel-Palestine for <a href="https://www.efe.com/efe/espana/1">Agencia EFE,</a> the major multimedia news agency in Spanish language and the world's fourth largest wire service, last year I embarked myself in the process of learning how to code and mine databases in order to write conclusive, impactful data-driven stories.<br><br> In order to do a different kind of journalism. <br><br> That's the reason why, after being awarded <em>La Caixa scholarship in 2020</em>, I am currently doing a Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University. <i class="fas fa-university"></i>

                                greatest movies list?</h3>
          <p class="has-text-justified is-size-5">             
          Back in 2016, 177 movie critics from all around the world (actually, 82 from the US) chose what they considered <a href="http://floatingmedia.com/columbia/BBC.html">the best 10 movies of the 21st Century.</a> In the end, only <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films">the 100 most voted </a> made it into a final list. A list with only 11 movies directed or co-directed by women. So we wondered: what other movies were selected but simply didn't appear on the final ranking? And lastly, do those movies -in general- portray more nuanced female characters, according to the Bechdel test?</p>

          Seaweed farming, a sector wounded to death by climate change, represents the lifeline <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/huria/article/view/152659"> of some 23,000 women</a> in the Tanzanian archipelago of Zanzibar. However, in recent years, good harvests have become less and less common due to much warmer superficial waters of up to 38 degrees Celsius. Pests and diseases seem to be the new normal.</p>
